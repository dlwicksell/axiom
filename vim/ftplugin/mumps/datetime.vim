" Imprints a datetime stamp, where the date is in ISO 8601 format,
" and the time is in a fairly standard format, at the end of the
" first line.
"
" It puts the datetime stamp in a location that follows the VISTA
" SAC. If you are not editing a VISTA routine, you may either turn
" this functionality off, by commenting out the autocmd at the
" bottom of this script, or it will just put it in the 3rd ';'
" piece, adding ';' characters, if needed.
"
" Added a toggle in normal mode, bound to Ctl-H that will toggle
" the datetime stamp on and off. When entering a mumps buffer it
" defaults to on.
